# Ratchet

Ratchet is:
- A generic blockchain library, which can be used to create any blockchain
  technology
- A bare-bones HTTP server
- A bitcoin-style blockchain implementation, where the data being stored
  in the ledger is proof of work (initial value), and transactions (moving
  value around)
- The startings of a Filecoin-style blockchain, where data being stored is
  proof that a file is stored and accessible. Still in progress. Or maybe
  it's done - I probably won't update this; I'm a lazy person

All from-scratch.

Meant as an exercise to familiarize myself with the blockchain,
and to learn Rust a bit more.
